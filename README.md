**Usage**
1. Download and install Rainmeter from https://www.rainmeter.net/
2. Download the C20Ticker3B_0.1.rmskin file in this repository and doubleclick to install this Rainmeter skin
3. If you want future value info to show on mouseover in the widget, as in the screenshot found at https://imgur.com/a/632cc or in screenshot below, you may open Rainmeter, go to Skins, click the Crypto20 Ticker widget folder and click through to the last file, the .ini file. Then, click edit to replace the contents of the .ini file with the C20Ticker3b_0.2.ini file in this repository.
      
		a. This modified ini file has LTC price and changes added, along with a line at the bottom where it 
		calculates daily growth rate (CAGR) and Future Value (FV) in 365 days if current daily growth rate 
		continues, assuming start date of Oct 7th when the pre-sale began. Future value line only shows when 
		you hover over it, but code has instructions in the last two lines of the .ini file on how to make it 
		show all the time.
